 - How to style calendar date

     - Can this be leveraged to style the calendar? 

Writing to e ink display: 
 - Option 1: https://github.com/samsonmking/epaper.js
     - Directly displays web page 
     - Doesn't work because of weirdness with puppeteer and chromium versions.
 
 - Options 2: custom script 
     - Have the web page running, every time the page is updated, generate a new image. 
     - When a new image is generated, write the image to the e ink display.   
     - check example epd_7in_5_V2_test.py. Can display JPG images, not just BMPs
     - Using playwright to take screenshot of browser
     - TODO currently trying to install epdlib module to be able to write to display.
